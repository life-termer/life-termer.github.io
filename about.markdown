## About me.

#### Who I am and what I am doing.

My name is Dmitry Surchin and I'm student at Higher vocational school B2 in Ljubljana. I am studding computer science and at my free time Java and C# programming.

#### How I got here.

I used to live in Russia and worked as a chief financial officer of a small construction company in Moscow. I was responsible for company financial accounting and made projects of air heating, ventilations and air conditioning systems.

Couple years ago I decided to change my career, start form scratch and get into IT world. I've always been passionate about computers and information technologies and dreamed to work in that field. So, since I started from the very beginning, I decided to do that somewhere abroad and chose Slovenia.

#### Where I am looking to go next.

Now I am looking for a place for IT internship related to software development and I'am lookong forward to apply my knowledge in practice. Meanwhile, Iâ€™m studding Java Spring and Hibernate frameworks and .Net environment. So, feel free to contact me anytime.ðŸ˜€
