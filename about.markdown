## About me.

#### Who I am and what I am doing.

My name is Dmitry Surchin and I'm student at Higher vocational school B2 in Ljubljana. I am studding computer science and at my free time Java programming.

#### How I got here.

I used to live in Russia and worked as a chief financial officer of a small construction company in Moscow. I was responsible for company financial accounting and made projects of air heating, ventilations and air conditioning systems.

Couple years ago I decided to change my career, start form scratch and get into IT world. I've always been passionate about computers and information technologies and dreamed to work in that field. So, since I started from the very beginning, I decided to do that somewhere abroad and chose Slovenia.

#### Where I am looking to go next.

Now I am looking for a place for student internship. I’ve already known a thing or two about Java programming, have made couple simple projects and I’m looking forward to apply my knowledge in practice. Meanwhile, I’m studding Spring and Hibernate frameworks.

Next year I am planning to graduate and find a permanent job in Slovenia. So, feel free to contact me anytime. :simple_smile:
